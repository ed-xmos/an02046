Example application
*******************

====================
Building the example
====================

This section assumes you have downloaded and installed the `XMOS XTC tools <https://www.xmos.com/software-tools/>`_
(see `README` for required version).
Installation instructions can be found `here <https://xmos.com/xtc-install-guide>`_.

Be sure to pay attention to the section `Installation of required third-party tools
<https://www.xmos.com/documentation/XM-014363-PC-10/html/installation/install-configure/install-tools/install_prerequisites.html>`_.

The application uses the `xcommon-cmake <https://www.xmos.com/file/xcommon-cmake-documentation/?version=latest>`_
build system as bundled with the XTC tools.

The ``an02046`` software zip-file should be downloaded and unzipped to a chosen directory.

To configure the build run the following from an XTC command prompt::

    cd an02046
    cd app_an02046
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -B build

All required dependencies are included in the software download, however, if any are missing it is
at this configure step that they will be downloaded by the build system.

Finally, the application binaries can be built using ``xmake``::

    xmake -j -C build

This command will cause a binaries (.xe files) to be generated in relevant subdirectories of the
`app_an02046/bin` directory, one for each of the build configurations.

===================
Running the example
===================

From a XTC command prompt run the following command from the `an02046/app_an02046` directory::

    xrun ./bin/app_an02046.xe

Alternatively the binary can be programmed into the non-volatile flash memory with the command::

    xflash ./bin/app_an02046.xe
